# Credora Protocol

*"Earn. Verify. Trust. On-Chain."*

A decentralized, incentive-driven credential verification protocol built on Moca Chain. Credora rewards users for acquiring verified credentials and compensates verifiers for validating them, creating a trustless, gamified ecosystem for credential management.
